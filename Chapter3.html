    <div class="chapter">
      <p>Months passed.</p>
      <p>And though the world was breaking, humanity clung to its last miracle.</p>
      <p>The Foundation, that mysterious machine built around the stolen heart of a dragon, had saved them from true extinction. As long as its core burned with magic, it created food—synthesized grain, clean water, warmth, power. It was a ghost of civilization, still running… still feeding.</p>
      <p>Strict rationing laws were enacted. Distribution schedules were posted. Fights broke out. Security tightened. But people survived.</p>
      <p>Hope flickered.</p>
      <p>Until—</p>
      <p>A sharp knocking echoed through the sterile halls of the Foundation chamber.</p>
      <p>Lydia Storm arrived, her cloak damp with cold sweat. Her breath was ragged from running.</p>
      <p>She found Amelia standing motionless at the center console—pale, shaking, eyes wide.</p>
      <p>Lydia stepped forward quickly.</p>
      <p>“What… happened, Amelia?” she demanded. “Did it really shut down?!”</p>
      <p>Amelia didn’t answer right away. Her hands trembled as she looked toward the core.</p>
      <p>“The Foundation…” she said slowly, her voice barely holding together. “I-it stopped working. I don’t know why. Everything was stable yesterday. But now—now it’s just… dead.”</p>
      <p>Lydia’s heart sank.</p>
      <p>The core chamber—normally glowing with magical red light—was now silent.</p>
      <p>No hum.<br>No pulse.<br>No life.</p>
      <p>Just cold metal.</p>
      <p>Lydia stared at it.</p>
      <p>The last thread holding her kingdom together had snapped.</p>
      <p>“How... why…?” Lydia whispered, her voice thin—barely there.</p>
      <p>She stared at the dead machine in disbelief, her hands trembling as if trying to grasp an explanation that wasn’t coming.</p>
      <p>Amelia’s breath hitched. Her eyes widened as the answer clicked together like rusted gears turning in her head.</p>
      <p>She stepped closer to the machine’s silent core.</p>
      <p>“...The dragon’s core,” she murmured, dread sinking into every word. “It’s... run out of magic.”</p>
      <p>Silence fell heavy over the room.</p>
      <p>Lydia blinked, as if refusing to believe it. “But… that core’s lasted for so long! . It's powered this place since before I was born.”</p>
      <p>“It was never meant to last forever,” Amelia whispered, her voice cracking. “Dragons accumulate magic over centuries—but once the heart is removed… it starts dying. Slowly. Quietly.”</p>
      <p>A day passed.</p>
      <p>News had spread—the Foundation had shut down.</p>
      <p>The hum that once echoed hope across Celestara was gone. The miracle machine that fed the last sparks of humanity... silent.</p>
      <p>Panic broke quickly. Whispers turned to shouts. But even in fear, many clung to the fragile belief that the royal researcher, Amelia Hartwell, would find a way—somehow. That this wouldn’t be the end.</p>
      <p>Lydia made a decision.</p>
      <p>Ration the last batch. Stretch it. Even if it meant some would go days without food.</p>
      <p>Hard choices. Choices a queen wasn’t ready for—but made anyway.</p>
      <p>The courtyards were filled with long, silent lines. Desperate eyes. Hollow cheeks. Parents cradling hungry children. Men gripping empty bowls like lifelines.</p>
      <p>Aina passed through them all.</p>
      <p>She said nothing—just walked with quiet steps, heart heavy. She knew where she was going.</p>
      <p>She reached the now-lifeless Foundation, its glowing veins dim, the air colder than usual. There, at the console, she saw Amelia.</p>
      <p>Collapsed against the desk, crying silently.</p>
      <p>Aina didn’t speak. She just stood there, letting the cold truth settle between them.</p>
      <p>The world was dying. And they were expected to stop it.</p>
      <p>Aina whispered softly, her voice low but warm.</p>
      <p>“Hey, Amelia… You okay there, bud?”</p>
      <p>She knelt beside her, gently patting her back in slow, calming motions. The mechanical hum that used to fill the Foundation had been replaced with an eerie, oppressive silence—one that pressed into their bones like cold iron.</p>
      <p>Amelia turned her tear-streaked face toward Aina, eyes red and trembling.</p>
      <p>“A-Aina… how am I supposed to even—”<br>She choked on her words.<br>“I-I c-can’t even think… W-why did o-our life turn like this…?”</p>
      <p>Her voice cracked beneath the weight of expectation. Of failure. She wasn’t just grieving the loss of the machine. She was grieving the people who would suffer because of it. People she couldn’t save.</p>
      <p>Aina looked at her for a long moment, then sat beside her, legs crossed like they were two kids hiding from the world behind old scrap metal.</p>
      <p>“You know…” she began softly, staring up at the dark, lifeless pipes above, “I used to think all this—royal tech, ancient cores, whatever—we had it handled. Like someone always had a plan. Even if it wasn’t me.”</p>
      <p>She sighed.</p>
      <p>“Now I’m not sure anyone had a plan.”</p>
      <p>Amelia sniffled. “T-The people think I can fix it… b-but I don’t even know where to start...”</p>
      <p>Aina glanced over, her silver hair falling slightly in front of her eyes.</p>
      <p>“Then start with me.”</p>
      <p>Amelia blinked.</p>
      <p>“You’re not alone, Amel. You’ve never been. Not while I’m around.”</p>
      <p>A faint smile tugged at her lips—wry, tired, but real.<br>“And hey, if the world’s gonna burn, might as well have a nap buddy through it, right?”</p>
      <p>Amelia let out a weak, broken laugh through her tears.</p>
      <p>Aina leaned back against the cold wall, her eyes drifting toward the dead core housing in the center of the Foundation.</p>
      <p>“…You’re trying to find a replacement, right?…”<br>Her voice was quiet, thoughtful.<br>“Me too. Got some ideas—but they weren’t exactly… fitting.”</p>
      <p>Amelia sniffled again and rubbed at her face with the sleeve of her lab coat.</p>
      <p>“I-I found some… alternatives. A-at least things that had high magic concentration...”<br>She shook her head, frustrated.<br>“But after I tested it… t-the core didn’t even react.”</p>
      <p>Her voice cracked with disappointment. The kind that comes after days of sleepless work and nothing to show for it.</p>
      <p>Aina tilted her head slightly.<br>“Maybe it’s not about power, then. Maybe it’s about compatibility.”</p>
      <p>Amelia looked at her. “H-huh?”</p>
      <p>Aina glanced at the inactive core and narrowed her eyes.</p>
      <p>“Think about it. That dragon’s core wasn’t just strong—it was alive. It didn’t just power things. It breathed magic. Maybe you can’t just shove raw energy into this thing and expect it to wake up.”</p>
      <p>She paused, fingers drumming idly against her leg.</p>
      <p>“...Maybe it needs a soul.”</p>
      <p>The words lingered in the air—chilling and vague.</p>
      <p>Amelia blinked slowly, her tear-streaked expression slowly turning thoughtful.<br>“Y-you mean like… living essence? A bond?”</p>
      <p>“Or a sacrifice,” Aina muttered, almost too quietly.</p>
      <p>Amelia's expression stiffened. She turned back to the silent machine, her heart pounding as new dread crept in to replace the old.</p>
      <p>Silence thickened in the chamber. Only the occasional flicker of broken screens and the soft hum of lifeless wires remained.</p>
      <p>Aina’s eyes were distant—her posture still, too still. Like something was weighing her down from the inside.</p>
      <p>She finally broke the silence.<br>“…Hey, Amelia…”<br>Her voice was quieter now, barely above a whisper.<br>“I’ll tell you something. But you have to promise to stay calm, okay?”</p>
      <p>Amelia blinked.<br>“O-Okay…?”</p>
      <p>Aina hesitated, then exhaled.</p>
      <p>“Inside me… there’s something. Something I shouldn’t have. Something no human should ever have.”</p>
      <p>She looked down at her gloved hands. As if they didn’t quite belong to her.</p>
      <p>“It’s… a core. A magical core. Not unlike the dragon’s.”<br>She glanced at the dead machine.<br>“It might… maybe—it could power the Foundation again.”</p>
      <p>Amelia’s breath caught in her throat.<br>“W-What?! That’s not even—A-Aina, humans can’t possibly hold that kind of power! I’ve read the reports. The body would collapse—the magic would burn you from the inside out!”</p>
      <p>Aina turned toward her, a weary look softening her expression.</p>
      <p>“Humans can’t, Amel…”</p>
      <p>Amelia froze. Her lips parted, but no sound came out.</p>
      <p>The air grew colder, as if the room itself had recoiled from the truth.</p>
      <p>“…W-what are you then…?”</p>
      <p>Aina didn’t answer right away. She just stared—at the wall, at the floor, at nothing in particular.</p>
      <p>Aina gave a dry chuckle—short, brittle, like she was laughing at her own cruelty.<br>"That part… doesn’t matter right now. What matters is…"<br>She trailed off, then looked away.<br>"I can’t exactly give my core, y’know? It would… well, you can guess."</p>
      <p>Her smile faded.</p>
      <p>"But I can’t. I just… I can’t."<br>Her voice lowered.<br>"My brother’s still out there. I have to find another way. We have to try something—anything—before we start thinking about things we can’t take back."</p>
      <p>Amelia stood frozen, pale, her hands gripping the edge of the desk until her knuckles went white.<br>She forced out a breath.</p>
      <p>"I-I could never… I won’t let that happen! The idea of—of having blood on my hands—!"<br>Her voice cracked.<br>"But if we don’t… if we don’t do something soon—so many will—"</p>
      <p>She couldn’t finish.</p>
      <p>Aina looked at her, the weight of the world behind her tired silver eyes.</p>
      <p>"Yeah..." she said quietly.<br>"Looks like we’re almost out of time."</p>
      <p>The machine behind them stood silent.<br>The lights flickered overhead.</p>
      <p>Outside the walls of the Foundation, hunger gnawed at the last patience of a dying world.</p>
