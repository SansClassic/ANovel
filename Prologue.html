    <h1>Prologue — The End of Light</h1>
    <p>A man stood alone.</p>
    <p>At his feet lay a mountain of demon corpses—charred, cleaved, crushed. A grotesque testament to his will.</p>
    <p>But more came.</p>
    <p>Always more.</p>
    <p>Hordes of the damned surged over the blackened hills, clawing and howling, their eyes wild with bloodlust. Tireless. Endless.</p>
    <p>The man gripped his sword tighter, shoulders rising with each labored breath.</p>
    <p>“…There is no end to these vile beings…”</p>
    <p>He could feel his body breaking—muscles screaming, bones cracking, vision blurring.</p>
    <p>But he didn’t fall.</p>
    <p>“I can’t give up… I won’t give up…”</p>
    <p>And so he fought.</p>
    <p>He fought as the sun rose and fell, as the moon bled light across a dying sky. Day after day. Night after night.</p>
    <p>He fought until time became meaningless.</p>
    <p>Until he was nothing but a blood-soaked echo of a warrior.</p>
    <p>And still, the demons came.</p>
    <p>Each swing of his blade cost more than the last. His footing faltered. His heartbeat slowed. His arms, once strong enough to fell titans, trembled.</p>
    <p>He knew.</p>
    <p>It wouldn’t be long now.</p>
    <p>Another blow. Another scream. Another flash of steel.</p>
    <p>His sword cracked.</p>
    <p>Then broke.</p>
    <p>And with it, so did the last hope of the world.</p>
    <p>He dropped to one knee, surrounded.</p>
    <p>“…If I fall… what happens next…?”</p>
    <p>The man stood, breath ragged, as the demonic tide closed in—each twisted face drawing nearer with every heartbeat.</p>
    <p>And in that moment, he remembered.</p>
    <p>A promise.</p>
    <p>A vow made long ago, when his hands were still clean and the world still believed in light.</p>
    <p>A promise to save them… To end the reign of the Demon King… To fix what had been broken.</p>
    <p>But now… now he stood at the edge.</p>
    <p>Alone.</p>
    <p>Bleeding.</p>
    <p>Powerless.</p>
    <p>“…I’m sorry… I’ve let you all do—”</p>
    <p>He never finished the thought.</p>
    <p>A clawed hand cracked across his skull—then another tore through his side.</p>
    <p>And another.</p>
    <p>And another.</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>The battlefield fell silent—except for the tearing of flesh and the distant echo of thunder.</p>
    <p>Then, from beyond the mortal veil… voices stirred.</p>
    <p>“The Champion has fallen…”</p>
    <p>“…How could these mere insects allow this?”</p>
    <p>A second voice, sharp with rage:</p>
    <p>“Unforgivable. Punish them for such negligence.”</p>
    <p>A third, venomous with scorn:</p>
    <p>“They squandered our blessing… wallowed in greed while their protector bled.”</p>
    <p>“Let them suffer.”</p>
    <p>“No mercy. No salvation.”</p>
    <p>Their words were not spoken—but decreed, like laws etched into the marrow of the world.</p>
    <p>And thus it began.</p>
    <p><strong>The Curse of Humanity.</strong></p>
