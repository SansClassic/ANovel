    <h1>Chapter 4: The Ugly World</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <div class="chapter">

<p>Three months passed.</p>

<p>The world had grown thinner.</p>

<p>Neighboring kingdoms fell to riots, lack of rations, and nothing to gain their trust.</p>

<p>Celestara quickly became overpopulated.</p>

<p>Immigrants—many fleeing collapsing cities—were sadly denied entry. Which led to chaos. Riots broke out outside the walls.</p>

<p>But the rules were strict. Nothing could be spared for this merciless world.</p>

<p>Celestara had its own problems to deal with.</p>

<p>Rations were barely scraps now—one full meal per week, and even that was considered mercy. Some received. Others starved. Desperation clung to every sunken face and trembling hand.</p>
      
<p>But a commotion broke the silence up ahead.</p>

<p>A mother’s voice—shrill, shaking, full of dread.</p>

<p>“BUT MY CHILD IS—!”</p>

<p>A Royal Guard snapped back instantly, his hand on his weapon.</p>

<p>“Lady, if you don’t step off right now, you’re gonna be in a world of pain. Rations are per head. You got yours—now move along.”</p>

<p>The mother clutched her child—frail, near-unmoving, the skin drawn tight across bones. Her arms were thin too—barely stronger than the infant she held.</p>

<p>She screamed again, voice cracking.</p>

<p>“Please! My son—he hasn’t eaten in days, he’ll die—!”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” the guard Standing Firm. “Come with me. Now.” They grabbed the woman by the arm and dragged her out of the line, ignoring her screams. They just dropped her at the end of the line like trash—and went back to work.</p>

<p>The mother lay on the cracked concrete, breathing in shallow gasps, her child’s limp hand pressed against her chest.</p>

<p>Aina watched it all.</p>

<p>She didn’t think. She moved.</p>

<p>Quietly, she knelt down beside the woman and placed a small paper-wrapped bundle in front of her.</p>

<p>Aina smiled gently. “Hey. Take this.”</p>

<p>The mother’s eyes widened. Her lips trembled.</p>

<p>“I-I… I don’t even know what to say… Thank you... Thank you so much… I—c-can’t even…”</p>

<p>Her voice broke. She tried to sit up, but her arms gave out. The weight of starvation, grief, and gratitude all mixed into a breathless collapse.</p>

<p>Aina gently rested a hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Save your strength,” she murmured. “Feed your child first.”</p>

<p>Aina left the line with a quiet smile, offering the mother a nod of hope before turning away. She didn’t expect thanks. She just hoped the child would see tomorrow.</p>

<p>The Foundation was colder than usual.</p>

<p>Inside, the silence felt heavier. Amelia stood alone in the dark, lit only by the occasional flicker of broken monitors. She didn’t turn when Aina entered.</p>

<p>The screen in front of her was still blank—just like it had been for weeks.</p>

<p>“Hey Amelia…” Aina called gently, her voice trying to stay light. “You good there…?”</p>

<p>She forced a smile. But Amelia didn’t return it.</p>

<p>“Aina…” she began softly, almost like a whisper. “Have you ever known exactly what you need to do… but you just didn’t have the strength to do it?”</p>

<p>Aina’s smile faded. Her steps slowed.</p>

<p>“Uh… yeah? I guess…” she replied cautiously, suddenly unsure. “I mean, everyone feels like that sometimes, right?”</p>

<p>Amelia finally turned.</p>

<p>Her eyes looked sunken. Tired. But worse— They looked resolved.</p>

<p>Amelia’s voice came out soft, like someone speaking from inside a dream.</p>

<p>“Then tell me, Aina… at your lowest point…” “Would you cross a line?”</p>

<p>Aina’s heart skipped. The room felt colder somehow.</p>

<p>“I… don’t know, Amel…” she said slowly. “Why are you asking me that?”</p>

<p>She tried to keep her voice even—nonthreatening. But caution bled into her words.</p>

<p>Amelia stared at her.</p>

<p>Really stared. As if she were trying to see through her—beneath skin and soul.</p>

<p>Aina felt her fingers twitch unconsciously near her side.</p>

<p>“Amelia…”</p>

<p>But Amelia suddenly broke eye contact—turning away as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>“I’m going to meet Lydia today,” she said flatly.</p>

<p>Then, without another word, she walked toward the exit— Right past Aina. Not stopping. Not looking back. Not even acknowledging her presence in the doorway.</p>

<p>Aina didn’t move.</p>

<p>She just stood there, staring at the empty space where her friend had been.</p>

<p>A quiet, invisible weight settled on her chest.</p>

<p>She wasn’t sure if Amelia was about to betray her. But she was absolutely sure of one thing:</p>

<p>Amelia Hartwell wasn’t the same girl anymore.</p>

<p>20 minutes passed.</p>

<p>Amelia entered the meeting chamber, her boots echoing faintly across the cold marble floor.</p>

<p>At the far end, Lydia stood hunched over the long stone table, draped in her black-and-gold cloak— but her shoulders sagged. Her skin had lost its warmth. Even her one sharp eye looked dulled from weeks of sleepless nights.</p>

<p>The Queen of Celestara looked barely alive.</p>

<p>Still, when she saw Amelia, a spark lit behind the exhaustion.</p>

<p>“Hey, Amel…” Lydia rasped, managing a tired smile. “So? What’s the plan you mentioned earlier?”</p>

<p>She almost sounded… hopeful.</p>

<p>Amelia inhaled deeply.</p>

<p>Her hands trembled once. Then stilled.</p>

<p>Her voice, when it came, was firm. Emotionless.</p>

<p>“Kill Aina.”</p>

<p>Silence. Thick. Absolute.</p>

<p>Lydia didn’t respond at first.</p>

<p>She simply stared—eye wide, unblinking.</p>

<p>“...What?” She forced a laugh. “I must’ve misheard. You didn’t just say—”</p>

<p>Amelia didn’t blink.</p>

<p>“You didn’t.”</p>

<p>The words dropped like lead between them.</p>

<p>“She has the answer we’re looking for,” Amelia said quietly. “Kill her. Extract her heart. And we can get the whole system running again. Easy, right?”</p>

<p>She smiled faintly, like she’d just solved a difficult puzzle.</p>

<p>Lydia stood frozen.</p>

<p>“...Amelia.” Her voice was soft, shaken. She stepped closer and placed a trembling hand on Amelia’s shoulder. “What makes you think Aina’s heart is the key?”</p>

<p>Amelia looked at her, expression calm. Clinical.</p>

<p>“Simple. Her heart contains more concentrated magic than anything I’ve ever seen. Enough to replace the Foundation’s core completely.”</p>

<p>She turned, gesturing toward the wall—toward the world beyond it.</p>

<p>“I used what little magic was left from the dragon’s heart. Just enough to run one last scan. To see how much power Aina’s core held.”</p>

<p>Amelia’s eyes gleamed.</p>

<p>“And you wanna know what I found?” She gave a short, breathless laugh. “Her core could power the Foundation for over a century. One hundred years of food, water, warmth—for everyone. Isn’t that incredible?”</p>

<p>She smiled wide.</p>

<p>Lydia took a half-step back. Her mouth opened—but no words came.</p>

<p>“...What the hell…” she whispered.</p>

<p>“You know Aina’s our friend,” she managed to say. “We can’t just—”</p>

<p>“Don’t use morals on me, Lydia,” Amelia cut her off. “Not now. Not when people are collapsing in the streets.”</p>

<p>Lydia’s hand dropped from Amelia’s shoulder. Her eyes darkened.</p>

<p>“Are you kidding me?! You can’t make me choose this! This isn’t right! Why the hell is this your solution?!”</p>

<p>Amelia snapped back.</p>

<p>“Because we have no other solution!”</p>

<p>Her voice cracked—raw and furious.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see what’s happening out there? Starving children. Riots. People dying in their sleep because we ran out of miracles!”</p>

<p>She was trembling now.</p>

<p>“Do you think I want this? Do you think I like it?! I’ve done everything I could—I’ve stayed awake for days—I’ve run every test, every scan—and she’s it. Aina is our only hope.”</p>

<p>Lydia clenched her fists against her head, shutting her eyes tight.</p>

<p>“No… No, Amel, you can’t… you can’t make me do this… Please... stop…”</p>

<p>Amelia stepped closer, her voice breaking now—desperate.</p>

<p>“Please, Lydia… You’re the only one who can make this call. Call her here tomorrow. Have her heart extracted. For everyone’s sake…”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>Lydia stood frozen—like a statue cracking under too much weight.</p>

<p><strong>The Next Day - Grilachil</strong></p>

<p>Aina was half-dozing at her usual seat in the bar, head resting lazily on the counter, when her phone buzzed against the wood.</p>

<p>She squinted at the screen.</p>

<p><em>Notification: Royal Summons — Meeting at Meeting Chamber</em></p>

<p>“…Huh?” she muttered, blinking. “No heads-up?, weird.” She rubbed the back of her neck. Something cold crawled down her spine.</p>

<p>Yesterday’s talk with Amelia still echoed in the back of her mind—but she pushed the thought aside with a lazy groan. From across the bar, Corvin looked up from his drink.</p>

<p>“wow, you literally just came in after being gone for months and your going again that quickly?”</p>

<p>Aina stretched with a yawn, standing from her stool.</p>

<p>“Yeah. smart pants stuff, I guess. Y’know—the usual.”</p>

<p>She gave him a quick two-finger salute and a playful wink.</p>

<p>“Save me a spot for tomorrow night.”</p>

<p>Corvin grinned.</p>

<p>“Always do.”</p>

<p>She stepped out into The Crimson Red That is the sky and muttered “has the world always been this ugly?...”</p>
