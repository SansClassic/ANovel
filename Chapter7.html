        <h1>Chapter 7 - Regretful Actions</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>A week had passed since the assassination of Eleria’s king.</p>
        <p>After Celestara’s swift takeover, the world fell eerily quiet. Too quiet.</p>
        <p>Aina had been granted freedom to roam the conquered kingdom—but she didn’t take it for granted. The stares,
            the whispers, the silent fear that followed her like a shadow… it was suffocating. No one said a word to
            her. No one dared. But she could feel it in the air: they didn’t see her as human.</p>
        <p>She didn’t want this.</p>
        <p>Wait… want?</p>
        <p>It was a strange realization—Aina wanted something. Something that wasn’t told. A choice. A thought that
            belonged to her.</p>
        <p>And so she left the city behind, wandering past crumbling watchtowers and overgrown roads, back to the edge
            of the forest—back to the small mound of earth where a boy now rested beneath the soil.</p>
        <p>The one who played the harmonica.</p>
        <p>She knelt beside his grave, not sure why she came back. Her head ached with the weight of a thousand borrowed
            memories—grief, longing, laughter, pain—all tangled together in a storm that wasn't hers, yet lived inside
            her.</p>
        <p>It hurt to remember.<br>But forgetting wasn’t an option either.</p>
        <p>One by one, she unraveled the moments stored in her mind—fragmented memories not her own, yet deeply felt.
        </p>
        <p>A father… picking up his newborn child.</p>
        <p>She could feel it all—his trembling hands as he held the baby close, the warmth in his chest, the overflowing
            joy that clouded his every thought.</p>
        <p>His plans for the future… a house filled with laughter, teaching the child to walk, to read, to dream.</p>
        <p>A man sitting beside a bonfire, surrounded by friends he hadn’t seen in years—smiling, laughing, retelling
            old stories like no time had passed.</p>
        <p>A man who wished to change the world through his actions—to build, to heal, to lead it somewhere brighter.
        </p>
        <p>A man at his lowest, lost and broken… until fate gave him a soulmate. Someone who saw him—not the scars, not
            the past—just him.</p>
        <p>All these memories.</p>
        <p>All these sensations.</p>
        <p>All these emotions.</p>
        <p>Happiness. Sadness. Anger. Greed. Pain.</p>
        <p>They weren’t hers. And yet… they felt familiar.</p>
        <p>She longed for her own emotions—to feel something that was hers, raw and real.</p>
        <p>To feel human.</p>
        <p>But deep down… she knew better.</p>
        <p>She wasn’t born. She was made.</p>
        <p>A weapon—nothing more.</p>
        <p>Aina turned away from the quiet grave, from the memories that weren’t hers, and made her way back to the
            kingdom of Eleria—now a fractured land under Celestara’s slow, steady occupation.</p>
        <p>She wasn’t looking for peace or closure.</p>
        <p>She was looking for him—the mysterious man behind her creation.</p>
        <p>She didn’t know why… curiosity? Anger? Or maybe, just maybe, a desperate need to understand herself.</p>
        <p>But before she could step past the castle gates—</p>
        <p>A war cry erupted from the southern fields.</p>
        <p><strong>"CHARGE!!!"</strong></p>
        <p>Aina froze.</p>
        <p>Soldiers.</p>
        <p>Familiar armor. Faded banners.</p>
        <p>The remnants of Eleria’s military—those who refused to surrender. Who still clung to the hope of rebuilding
            their fallen kingdom.</p>
        <p>They came charging across the open hills like a final wave against the tide.</p>
        <p>Her eyes narrowed.</p>
        <p>She didn’t want this.</p>
        <p>But she knew these people—they would bring chaos, and Celestara would respond with force. The last thing the
            world needed now was another bloodbath.</p>
        <p>So she moved.</p>
        <p>In a blink, Aina crossed the battlefield with inhuman speed, catching one of the soldiers mid-swing. Her hand
            clamped around the shaft of their spear.</p>
        <p>Instinct told her to kill.</p>
        <p>To silence the threat.</p>
        <p>Her blade was already half-raised… before she stopped herself.</p>
        <p>Her heart pounded—not from fear, but hesitation. Guilt. Humanity.</p>
        <p>She didn’t want to kill. Not anymore.</p>
        <p>She looked into the soldier’s eyes—young, scared, desperate.</p>
        <p>“What future might you have had, if not for me?”<br>(I wish I didn’t have to wonder that)</p>
        <p>With a breathless whisper, Aina dropped the blade.</p>
        <p>Instead, she reeled back her arm and struck the man across the helmet. His iron visor bent inward from the
            force, and he collapsed instantly, unconscious but alive.</p>
        <p>And then… came the rest.</p>
        <p>Twenty-two soldiers, each charging with fury and grief.</p>
        <p>But Aina held back.</p>
        <p>No blades. No blood.</p>
        <p>Only fists.</p>
        <p>A blur through the battlefield—each strike a thunderclap, each soldier dropped with a single blow. Armor
            cracked, swords flew, but no lives were taken.</p>
        <p>They fell one by one until silence returned to the field.</p>
        <p>Aina stood in the middle of the field—surrounded by broken spears, unconscious soldiers, and a choice she
            never thought she’d make.</p>
        <p>Minutes later, Celestara’s soldiers arrived, sweeping through the aftermath. Without a word, they moved past
            her to gather the unconscious rebels. No questions. No praise. Not even a glance.</p>
        <p>As if she were a ghost.</p>
        <p>Aina watched them work for a moment, then turned and walked away—toward the lab.</p>
        <p>Toward him.</p>
        <p>The lab was as cold and sterile as ever, humming faintly with arcane machines. And there he was—the mystery
            man—standing at his table with an all-too-familiar grin.</p>
        <p>“You’re back! Did you have fun with your day off? I sure wish I had one! Haha!” His laugh echoed off the
            walls with an artificial cheer.</p>
        <p>Aina said nothing, only narrowing her eyes at him.</p>
        <p>He tilted his head slightly. “C’mon, you can talk to me, you know.”</p>
        <p>A pause. Then, with a sigh, he leaned against the table and said, “You know... I used to have a daughter.”
        </p>
        <p>Aina blinked.</p>
        <p>“Her name was Dahlia,” he continued, his tone softening. “She was everything to me. Bright, curious, full of
            questions I couldn’t always answer. But this job… this cursed work...”</p>
        <p>He shook his head.</p>
        <p>“I was expected everywhere at once. I didn’t even have time to breathe. But one day—I had to go. A long
            expedition. Deep into what we now call The Dark Forest.”</p>
        <p>Aina’s brow furrowed.</p>
        <p>He smiled bitterly. “That forest is… a creature of its own. The paths shift like tides. The trees move,
            hunting sunlight. It’s a maze no map can hold.”</p>
        <p>He glanced up at her.</p>
        <p>“What does this have to do with Dahlia?”</p>
        <p>He exhaled.</p>
        <p>“She wanted to be an adventurer. Always said she’d explore every inch of the world, even the parts I warned
            her about. I told her I could provide for her forever, that she didn’t need to risk herself. But she said
            that would mean living without a dream.”</p>
        <p>He paused, the silence pressing down.</p>
        <p>“I let her go.”</p>
        <p>Another breath.</p>
        <p>“I shouldn’t have,” he whispered.</p>
        <p>His fingers clenched tightly around the edge of the table.</p>
        <p>“I should’ve known she’d go. I knew her… and still, I let her go.”<br>
            His voice trembled. “I begged the king. I begged him to send an expedition.”</p>
        <p>Aina stayed silent, listening.</p>
        <p>“...‘What benefit would it gain me if she were alive?’”</p>
        <p>He chuckled bitterly—emptily.</p>
        <p>“I stared at him, hoping... praying it was just a test. That maybe, just maybe, he'd change his mind.”</p>
        <p>A long pause.</p>
        <p>“But a day passed. Then a week. Then months. Nothing. No sign of her. No rescue. No grave.”<br>
            His eyes narrowed. “I couldn’t bear it. The thought that… if we had just sent someone—if I had insisted—she
            might still be alive.”</p>
        <p>He turned away, looking at the flickering glyphs on the wall as though they might give him peace.</p>
        <p>“So I lied. I asked the king for permission to enter the forest. Said it was for research—‘sample
            collection,’ I called it.”</p>
        <p>A breath. Sharp. Shaky.</p>
        <p>“I searched. Day after day. Week after week. Every path, every grove, every tree that had moved from where it
            was the day before.”<br>
            “I found nothing. Not even bones.”</p>
        <p>He stopped, then slowly looked back at Aina.</p>
        <p>“Until I discovered it.”</p>
        <p>His voice dipped into something darker.</p>
        <p>“I found a way out. A path that didn’t lead back to our lands.”</p>
        <p>Aina tensed.</p>
        <p>“It was… wrong. The air was thick. Rotten. Like the land itself was dying.”<br>
            “It wasn’t part of this world. It was another place entirely.”</p>
        <p><strong>“It’s what we now call The Demon Lair.”</strong></p>
        <p>He smiled faintly, but there was no joy.</p>
        <p>“The true home of the monsters. The breeding ground of everything that bleeds into our world.”</p>
        <p>He paused, then smiled—hollow and distant.</p>
        <p>“You want to know what I did?”</p>
        <p>Aina didn’t respond. She didn’t need to.</p>
        <p>“Of course I went in,” he said, his tone low. “I was terrified. The air alone felt like it was burning
            through every living cell in my lungs. But I couldn’t turn back.”</p>
        <p>“I kept walking—slow, careful steps. Avoiding any monster I could. But hours passed… maybe more. Time felt
            wrong there. And still, I couldn’t find her.”</p>
        <p>His eyes clouded, drifting to the past.</p>
        <p>“Then… in the distance, I saw it.”</p>
        <p>His voice dropped, reverent and fearful.</p>
        <p>“A castle. Massive. Towering. Its sheer size felt like it was pressing down on my soul.”</p>
        <p>He stopped, a chill creeping into his breath.</p>
        <p>“It felt… wrong. Alive, almost. Breathing. Watching.”</p>
        <p>He shook the thought off.</p>
        <p>“No matter. I approached it. Step by step. Took me hours just to reach the gates, the castle was that huge.”
        </p>
        <p>“I expected monsters—crowds of them. Legions. But… no.”</p>
        <p>His fingers trembled slightly.</p>
        <p>“It was empty. Completely. Just silence. Too silent.”</p>
        <p>“Inside, it stretched endlessly. Pillars—each wider than the trunks of ten trees—reached up into a ceiling I
            couldn’t even see. It was as if the roof was swallowed by the void itself.”</p>
        <p>“Then… I saw him.”</p>
        <p><strong>The Demon King.</strong></p>
        <p>He swallowed, as if the words themselves were bitter.</p>
        <p>“Every instinct in my body screamed at me to run. To kneel. To beg. I could feel it—one wrong move and I
            would die. Just like that.”</p>
        <p>“But before I could even think of running... he spoke.”</p>
        <p><em>“Interesting… A human… wandered so far from their safe little cage, and into my home?”</em></p>
        <p>The man exhaled sharply.</p>
        <p><em>“You’ve done well to survive the entire region of monsters out there,”</em><br>
            the Demon King’s voice echoed from the throne, each word laced with amusement.<br>
            <em>“I can feel it. You’re nothing but a mere ant that somehow managed to cross a waterfall.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>His laughter echoed again—dark, hollow, almost playful.</p>
        <p><em>“I can’t even sense an ounce of magic from you. Quite pathetic.”</em></p>
        <p>A pause. A shift.</p>
        <p><em>“But for you to have made it here at all… I’ll give you one chance. Turn back now. While I’m still being
                nice.”</em></p>
        <p><strong>Nice?</strong><br>
            The Demon King… being nice?</p>
        <p>The man clenched his fists, his voice shaking.</p>
        <p>“I—I came here… I was searching for my daughter. She’s gone missing. I think she… she might’ve wandered into
            the Dark Forest.”</p>
        <p>Silence.</p>
        <p>Then, a low hum.</p>
        <p><em>“Hmmm… You really went this far for your own flesh and blood?”</em><br>
            The Demon King’s tone turned mockingly soft.<br>
            <em>“How touching. How quaint.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>He leaned forward from the throne, just enough for his crimson eyes to shine through the gloom.</p>
        <p><em>“Humans and their attachments. Always chasing love. Purpose. Redemption. It’s adorable, really.”</em></p>
        <p>His voice deepened, almost disappointed.</p>
        <p><em>“But let me ask you something, father of the year… What would you sacrifice for her return? Your freedom?
                Your body? Your soul?”</em></p>
        <p>The man’s breath caught.</p>
        <p><strong>“My soul means nothing if my daughter can be back in my arms,”</strong> he said firmly, his voice
            steel.</p>
        <p>Silence. As though the Demon King were holding in laughter.</p>
        <p><strong>The Demon King gave an ominous smile.</strong></p>
        <p><em>“Then, how about I tell you a way?...”</em></p>
