      <p>An hour After The Curse Has Set In Stone.</p>
      <p>The castle halls echoed with the sharp click of boots on marble. Lydia Storm stormed through corridor after corridor, her voice sharp with fury.</p>
      <p>“Dammit, where the hell did the old man go?! The kingdom’s going to hell and he’s just—gone? As if there’s nothing happening out there?!”</p>
      <p>Torches along the walls flickered as she passed, casting long shadows behind her. She shoved open door after door—war rooms, meeting chambers, even the old dining hall—but found nothing.</p>
      <p>Her anger burned hotter with each step.</p>
      <p>Finally, she reached the king’s chamber. Her hand hovered over the brass handle.</p>
      <p>She hesitated.</p>
      <p>“What if… what if he’s just asleep?” She shook her head violently. “Dammit, what do I care?! He needs to face the people now!”</p>
      <p>She threw the doors open.</p>
      <p>And stopped cold.</p>
      <p>The room was silent—too silent. A foul stench hung in the air, thick and nauseating. Curtains fluttered from a broken window. Papers lay scattered across the floor.</p>
      <p>Then her eyes locked on the bed.</p>
      <p>What remained of King Aldrich Storm lay motionless beneath silken sheets, his once-proud form now a crumbling, rotted husk. Golden hair dulled and lifeless. The curse had claimed him.</p>
      <p>Lydia took a step back, her breath catching.</p>
      <p>“What...How...”</p>
      <p>Tears welled in her eye—the other hidden behind her worn eyepatch—as her fists clenched in rage.</p>
      <p>He didn’t run. He didn’t hide. The gods took him—because they knew.</p>
      <p>They knew that if Aldrich had lived, he would have restored order. Stopped the chaos.</p>
      <p>But the gods didn’t want order.</p>
      <p>They wanted humanity broken.</p>
      <p>And now, Lydia stood alone.</p>
      <p>Guards followed behind Lydia, catching up just as she stood frozen in the doorway.</p>
      <p>One of them choked on his breath.</p>
      <p>“...Is that…?”</p>
      <p>They couldn’t even finish the sentence.</p>
      <p>The stench of death seeped out past the threshold, thick as guilt.</p>
      <p>A priest—one of the royal clergy—stepped forward in trembling silence. He fell to his knees beside the doorframe, fingers lacing in a desperate prayer.</p>
      <p>“O god, please forgive this poor soul… He was strong… We were weak… Humanity made a mistake… Please... don’t take such a strong soul…”</p>
      <p>His voice broke, but the silence in the room didn’t. The gods weren’t listening.</p>
      <p>Of course they weren’t.</p>
      <p>Lydia didn’t look back. She stared at her father’s lifeless form, face unreadable.</p>
      <p>Then, after a long pause, she whispered:</p>
      <p>“...Then I’ll speak loud enough to make them listen.”</p>
      <p>Lydia stood still as the guards murmured behind her.</p>
      <p>But her mind wasn’t in the present anymore.</p>
      <p>It drifted—dragged back into the shadows of a night long buried.</p>
      <p>She had been eight years old.</p>
      <p>The royal halls had felt colder than usual. That night, she’d been sitting by the window of her chamber, staring into the dark garden outside.</p>
      <p>And then… something moved.</p>
      <p>She blinked, confused. Was it just the wind? A shadow?</p>
      <p>She shook her head. “I’m just imagining things.”</p>
      <p>She turned away—only to hear the faintest creak of glass behind her.</p>
      <p>By the time she realized it wasn’t her imagination, it was too late.</p>
      <p>The assassin was already inside.</p>
      <p>Lydia’s eyes widened. She screamed and bolted for the door, but a gloved hand seized her by the arm. The blade came fast—aimed straight for her heart.</p>
      <p>She twisted.</p>
      <p>The steel cut through air.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t luck. Not a miracle either.</p>
      <p>It was magic. Instinctive and raw.</p>
      <p>A ripple of golden force flared from her skin, just enough to throw the assassin off balance.</p>
      <p>She broke free and ran, barefoot and shaking, down the hallway to her siblings' room. Her little fists pounded the door open.</p>
      <p>But she was too late.</p>
      <p>The assassin had gotten there first.</p>
      <p>She stood frozen at the doorway, staring in horror.</p>
      <p>Blood. Too much of it.</p>
      <p>Lydia’s breath caught in her throat. Her legs trembled beneath her. All she could whisper was—</p>
      <p>“Where… where were the guards…?”</p>
      <p>No one answered.</p>
      <p>There had never been guards.</p>
      <p>Not for the royal children.</p>
      <p>She remembered the words her father once said during a cold, silent dinner:</p>
      <p>“If you can’t survive on your own, then the throne is not for you.”</p>
      <p>Even then—he had been testing them.</p>
      <p>Even then—he had chosen the crown over his children.</p>
      <p>Lydia blinked, dragged back into the present. The king’s corpse still lay before her—hollow, rotting, silent in death as he was in life.</p>
      <p>She stared at him for a long time, her breathing slow, almost shaky.</p>
      <p>“No one came for us then…” she whispered. “Not even you.”</p>
      <p>Her eye drifted to the floor. She clenched her fists—but there was no anger this time. Just the weight of memory pressing down on her.</p>
      <p>“I made a promise… That I’d become strong. That I’d protect those who couldn’t protect themselves.”</p>
      <p>Her voice caught.</p>
      <p>“And I swore I’d never… I’d never take that throne. I wouldn’t become like you.”</p>
      <p>The words hung in the air like smoke.</p>
      <p>She didn’t move. Didn’t speak again. Just stood there, trapped in the gravity of her own promise—torn between who she was, and what the world now demanded of her.</p>
      <p>Outside the chamber, the kingdom waited for an answer.</p>
      <p>But inside, Lydia Storm remained still.</p>
      <p>She didn’t know what to do.</p>
      <p>Not yet.</p>
      <p><strong>One Hour Before the Throne Ascension – Meeting Chamber</strong></p>
      <p>The grand meeting chamber stood in silence, the air heavy with tension. Lydia stood alone near the center table, staring blankly at the stone floor. Pale, sleepless, and unmoving—like a statue carved from worry.</p>
      <p>The door creaked open.</p>
      <p>Amelia stepped in slowly, the hem of her lab coat brushing the marble.</p>
      <p>She gasped softly. “L-Lydia… you look so pale. D-Did you even sleep...?”</p>
      <p>Lydia jolted, blinking as if pulled from another world. “Oh—Amelia. I… didn’t hear you come in. Sorry.” She offered a weak chuckle. “I just… haven’t been able to sleep at all.”</p>
      <p>Amelia took a few hesitant steps closer, eyes full of concern. “I-I know… the stress is heavy. Crushing, even. But please—tell me what you need. D-Don’t carry all this alone…”</p>
      <p>Lydia turned her head slightly, forcing a crooked smile. “Heh… You know me, Amel. I’m strong, right? Always have been...”</p>
      <p>Silence.</p>
      <p>Not cold. Not tense. Just the kind that hangs when there are too many thoughts and too few words.</p>
      <p>Then Lydia spoke—quietly, as if admitting it to herself more than to Amelia. “I just... I don’t know if I can lead people with a hope that isn’t even real.” Her voice wavered. “This curse… how do we fight something like that? You can’t just swing a sword at the gods.”</p>
      <p>Amelia reached out, gently placing a hand on Lydia’s back.</p>
      <p>“Lydia,” she said, voice soft but firm, “You’re strong. Th-The strongest girl I’ve ever met…” She looked away briefly, then back with a determined tremble. “J-Just because you think you can’t… doesn’t mean it’s impossible. You just need time. You just need… to let yourself grow into it.” She smiled nervously. “You don’t have to be a ruler all at once. Just take one step... at a time.”</p>
      <p>Lydia’s eyes stayed fixed on the stone tiles beneath her feet.</p>
      <p>"...You're right,” she whispered. “My people... they’re going to die one by one. Hopeless and afraid…” She exhaled slowly, bitter and tired. “If I can’t save them… then at the very least, I should give them something to cling to. Even if it’s just a dying breath of hope… that this world might keep going.”</p>
      <p>Amelia’s voice trembled with gentle strength. “Th-that’s right… You need to be strong, Lydia. Strong enough for them. And I’ll be with you, o-of course… always.”</p>
      <p>Lydia looked at her—really looked at her—and gave the smallest, most honest nod.</p>
      <p>And then—</p>
      <p>The kingdom gates creaked open.</p>
      <p>Lydia Storm stepped forward, framed by the rising sun behind her and the shadows of ruin before her. Her cloak of black and gold billowed in the wind, her eyepatch sharp against her fierce yellow gaze.</p>
      <p>She faced the crowd—starved, broken, near-mad from grief.</p>
      <p>And she shouted.</p>
      <p>“I PROMISE—IF YOU SUPPORT MY REIGN, I WILL FIND OUR WAY OUT OF THIS HELLISH NIGHTMARE!”</p>
      <p>Her voice rang out like steel on stone.</p>
      <p>It echoed across the city. Across dry rooftops and cracked roads. Across empty homes and dying gardens.</p>
      <p>Few Doubted her.</p>
      <p>After all… how could a mortal queen stand against the wrath of the gods?</p>
      <p>But even a lie—if Sweet Enough, Could keep the despair at bay.</p>
      <p>No one cheered.</p>
      <p>But for the first time in weeks…</p>
      <p>They listened.</p>
