    <h1>Chapter 6 — Past Experiments</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Her head throbbed. Pain pulsed through her skull like a warning siren.</p>
    <p>But something else followed.</p>
    <p><strong>60 years earlier – Inside Aina's Mind</strong></p>
    <p>A voice.<br>(######..?)</p>
    <p>Slick and unnatural, it slithered into her mind like an old nightmare.<br>(is...this the past? why...)</p>
    <p>“Oh… how wonderful! My little experiment is finally awake.”<br>(...Ironic how you've fallen)</p>
    <p>Aina blinked.</p>
    <p>And suddenly—she wasn’t in the meeting chamber anymore.</p>
    <p>She stood in a lab.</p>
    <p>A familiar one. Cold. Sterile. Bathed in white light and humming machines.<br>(I hated it)</p>
    <p>Across the room, a man stood smiling behind a glass panel. His face was blurry—like a memory refusing to come into focus.</p>
    <p>“Do you feel anything?” the man asked, voice unnervingly cheerful.<br>(Don't want to feel)</p>
    <p>Aina said nothing. She couldn’t. Her mouth didn’t seem to belong to her.<br>(should've stayed that way)</p>
    <p>The man tilted his head thoughtfully. “Ah… You haven’t Learned This world's language yet. No wonder you’re confused.”</p>
    <p>He guided her—took her hand and placed a small knife in it. Then he pointed.</p>
    <p>A strange, gelatinous creature wriggled weakly on the metal table.</p>
    <p>“Go on. Try it.”</p>
    <p>Her arm moved.<br>(No way back now)</p>
    <p>The knife plunged into the creature’s core.</p>
    <p>It let out a faint cry—and stilled.</p>
    <p>And then—like a dam bursting—memories crashed into Aina’s mind.</p>
    <p>But they weren’t hers.<br>(…)</p>
    <p>She felt Fear and hunger from the creature she had just killed.</p>
    <p>She stumbled back, gasping, breath stolen from her lungs.</p>
    <p>The man smiled wider. “Fascinating, isn’t it? That little blob was one of my failures. Just like you… once. But you’re not a failure. Not yet.”</p>
    <p>He stepped closer.</p>
    <p>“You understand me now, right?”<br>(…I don't want to )</p>
    <p>Aina gave a small, slow nod.</p>
    <p>The man clapped once.</p>
    <p>“Perfect! That means one of your core enhancements has finally settled in.”</p>
    <p>He leaned forward, examining her with something between admiration and hunger.</p>
    <p>“Let’s see just how interesting you can become.”</p>
    <p>Aina was guided again—led down corridors of the facility, metal doors hissing open one after another.</p>
    <p>This time, he spoke plainly. Coldly.</p>
    <p>“You are an artificial human. Designed and assembled from a fusion of Many souls—stitched together in one vessel.”</p>
    <p>They arrived at a reinforced chamber.</p>
    <p>“Your sole purpose,” he continued, “is to serve our great nation at the frontlines. You are the weapon we’ve been dreaming of.”</p>
    <p>Aina just stood there—eyes blank, thoughts buried beneath fog.</p>
    <p>“Time for your first test.”</p>
    <p>He gestured toward a room where a wounded goblin lay curled in the corner, breathing shallowly. It barely had strength to move.</p>
    <p>“Kill it. Anywhere you like. Let’s see what you get.”</p>
    <p>Without hesitation, her body obeyed. Knife. Throat. Silence.</p>
    <p>And again—</p>
    <p>A flood of foreign memories.</p>
    <p>This time it was different.</p>
    <p>She felt… faster.</p>
    <p>Stronger. Her instincts sharpened, like she could hear and smell the world with new precision.</p>
    <p>“Ah!” the man cried out in delight. “You feel it, don’t you? The enhancement. That Power And Agility.”</p>
    <p>Aina nodded slowly. The sensations were real.</p>
    <p>He clapped again—excited like a child.</p>
    <p>“It works. It really works!”</p>
    <p>His voice grew more animated as he walked circles around her.</p>
    <p>“With each kill, you gain their essence. Their memories. Their instincts. We’ll harvest every scrap of information, without questioning, just clean, efficient assimilation!”</p>
    <p>Aina stood still.</p>
    <p>Still numb.</p>
    <p>Still hollow.</p>
    <p>But something stirred quietly in the back of her mind.</p>
    <p>A whisper. A thought. Something broken, but alive.</p>
    <p>Was this all I ever was?<br>(Yes)</p>
    <p>The man’s voice cut through.</p>
    <p>“Come on, now! We need to make you stronger! Faster! You’re going to wipe out those annoying kingdoms like a storm! Let’s go—onto the next room!”</p>
    <p>But Aina didn’t move.<br>Not yet.</p>
    <h2>Months passed.</h2>
    <p>Aina was fed prey—monster after monster, demon after demon.</p>
    <p>She killed them all.</p>
    <p>With every death came memories not her own—fragments of borrowed dreams stitched into her skull.</p>
    <p>Until the day came.</p>
    <p>The promised war.</p>
    <p>The neighboring kingdom—enraged by Celestara’s seizure of long-disputed land—declared retaliation. They prepared an army. Thousands strong.</p>
    <p>What awaited them…</p>
    <p>Was one soldier.</p>
    <p>She stood alone in the dead plains—motionless, her silver hair drifting in the wind, eyes dull as steel left in the snow.
    <br>From behind their banners, the enemy soldiers stared in disbelief.</p>
    <p>“Is this some kind of joke…?” one murmured. “They sent a girl?”</p>
    <p>The commander scowled, hand tightening on his reins. <br>“If they want to mock us—then fine. Give them hell.”</p>
    <p>He raised his sword.</p>
    <p>“CHARGE!”</p>
    <p>The army surged forward. <br>Blades clashing, boots thundering, war cries piercing the dawn.</p>
    <p>Then—<br>the first blink came.And in that blink—<br>Half their front line fell.</p>
    <p>Blood painted the field in a mist of red. Heads rolled. Limbs twitched.</p>
    <p>Aina stood in their midst. Blade dripping. Breath steady. Eyes hollow.</p>
    <p>“W-what the hell—?! She’s—”</p>
    <p>The voice was cut short. So was the man.</p>
    <p>Steel met flesh again and again. Screams rose, only to die a breath later.</p>
    <p>By nightfall, the field was silent.</p>
    <p>Only two stood. <br> Aina And the commander, now bleeding from a dozen wounds, barely able to hold his weapon.</p>
    <p>He lunged with a final, broken roar. <br>And she ended him.</p>
    <p>Just as the morning sun crested the hills, the last soldier fell.</p>
    <p>The wind swept over the corpses.</p>
    <p>Aina stood still, blood-soaked, staring down at the commander’s empty eyes.</p>
    <p>And then— <br> The memories surged.</p>
    <p>A wife’s sobs. A child’s laugh. A brother’s drunken dance around a bonfire. A name whispered in prayer. A flag gripped in a dying hand. <br>She didn’t understand any of it. <br> Didn’t know what to do with their grief.</p>
    <p>So she turned her back on it. <br> And walked back to the kingdom of celestara.</p>
    <p>Behind her, the sun rose over a graveyard of men.</p>
    <p>And far away, in a darkened chamber filled with watching eyes and twisted smiles—</p>
    <p>he spoke again.</p>
    <p>“I am absolutely overjoyed!” the voice purred. <br> “You did it, my beautiful creation. You are perfect.” A pause. <br> “Now… go.” <br> “Overthrow that pathetic king for me.”<br>“For me. And for Celestara.”</p>
    <p>Aina walked through the streets of Celestara—once vibrant, now hushed.</p>
    <p>Worried faces turned as she passed.</p>
    <p>Eyes filled with fear, confusion, quiet judgment. like a ghost walking through the ruins of something once good.</p>
    <p>Aina didn’t understand their stares. <br>(I wish i didn't)<br>She didn’t understand emotion.<br>(I Wished I wasn't curious)<br>Why did they look at her like that?<br>(I Don't care)<br>Why did her chest ache so slightly?<br>(...Naivety)<br>She kept walking.<br>(i Wished i stopped)</p>
    <p>She found herself deep in the Forest of Fallen Men, where the sky never quite pierced the canopy and the only scent was blood—coppery, thick, and clinging.</p>
    <p>The battlefield still whispered its grief. <br> But something new cut through the silence. <br>Smoke.</p>
    <p>Thin, pale smoke, curling into the dark trees. A sign of life.<br>Aina followed it. Her purpose returned.<br>A variable remained.</p>
    <p>When she reached the source, she found him:</p>
    <p>A young man, barely older than a teen, slouched by a dying fire. His right arm was gone, crudely cauterized, and his skin pale from blood loss.<br>(...)<br>But he was awake.</p>
    <p>“Anyone there…?” he rasped, squinting into the trees. “I won’t live long… you know? Heh…”</p>
    <p>Aina stepped into the light. <br>The boy didn’t flinch. <br> “Hey… you didn’t see my harmonica, did you?” he murmured, looking around weakly.</p>
    <p>Aina glanced at his feet and pointed.</p>
    <p>He followed her finger, chuckled faintly.<br>“Oh… there it is. Sorry. Vision’s not great anymore…”</p>
    <p>With shaky fingers, he picked it up. <br>“You should listen. Won’t be long now anyway…”</p>
    <p>Aina paused. Something tugged at her—not curiosity. Not pity. <br> She sat across the fire from him. Silent.</p>
    <p>The flames crackled low.</p>
    <p>“This one… was made by my mom,” the boy said, holding up the harmonica. “I joined the army because they promised gold. We needed it. My mom’s sick. Bad lungs. Said it’d pay for medicine…”</p>
    <p>He shrugged, winced. <br> “Not that you’d care. Stranger like you.”<br>And then—he played.</p>
    <p>The music was shaky, breathy… but beautiful.<br>Wavering notes drifted into the forest like a last prayer.<br>The fire dimmed with every note.</p>
    <p>“…heh,” he muttered. “Not like it’ll matter soon…”</p>
    <p>His hands dropped to his lap.<br>“Hey… can you deliver something for me? Just give it to one of the guards at Eleria. They’ll know…”</p>
    <p>He coughed. His voice slurred.<br>“…they’ll know what to…”<br>Thud.<br>(I'm sorry)</p>
    <p>The harmonica slipped from his hand. <br>The fire flickered once… and died.</p>
    <p>Aina sat still.<br>No command told her what to do next.<br>No voice guided her.<br>Only the envelope remained, resting in the boy’s lap, now slowly slipping to the earth.</p>
    <p>She stared at the words written on its surface in crooked, desperate handwriting.</p>
    <p>"Dear Mom."<br>Aina’s mind flashed.<br>She stood still beside the boy’s corpse, her thoughts drowning beneath a tide of alien memories.<br>Thousands of fragmented images—foreign and invasive—rushed through her like water breaching a dam.</p>
    <p>"Mother."<br>A figure—sometimes gentle, sometimes cold, sometimes blind to her child’s pain—but always there. Always trying.<br>Was that what a mother was?<br>Aina couldn’t understand.</p>
    <p>But something inside her stirred. Something unfamiliar.<br>A creeping sensation crawling up from the pit of her chest—tight, sour, unbearable.<br>Guilt.</p>
    <p>She’d never felt it before.</p>
    <p>But now? Now it wouldn’t leave.</p>
    <p>She stood, letter in hand, and turned toward the horizon.</p>
    <p>She made her way toward the neighboring kingdom—Eleria.</p>
    <p>The guards at the gates barely gave her a glance, mistaking her for another traveler or adventurer.</p>
    <p>They let her in. Just like that.</p>
    <p>Careless.</p>
    <p>But Aina didn’t act. Not today.</p>
    <p>She wandered the unfamiliar streets, heart quiet but heavy, eyes scanning the faces around her.</p>
    <p>And what she saw left her... confused.</p>
    <p>Genuine smiles.</p>
    <p>Laughter rang out from alleyways and windows.</p>
    <p>Children danced beneath ribbons of colored light strung above the streets. Music drifted on the wind.</p>
    <p>It was a festival.</p>
    <p>Aina stared.</p>
    <p>She didn’t understand how a place could feel so… whole.</p>
    <p>(“…I’ll let them be. For now…”)</p>
    <p>She moved through the streets, asking quietly—awkwardly—for directions.</p>
    <p>Eventually, a guard stopped her. His eyes caught on the letter in her hand.</p>
    <p>“Hey, miss! That envelope—can I see it?”</p>
    <p>Aina paused.</p>
    <p>“…Why?”</p>
    <p>The guard stepped closer. His gaze fell to the familiar handwriting on the front.</p>
    <p>His face went pale.</p>
    <p>“…T-this is… where did you get this?” he asked, his voice trembling.</p>
    <p>“A boy gave it to me,” Aina replied, flatly. “With his last breath.”</p>
    <p>He went still.</p>
    <p>“No… no way. My brother…”</p>
    <p>“Brother?” Aina tilted her head. “You’re his family?”</p>
    <p>“…Yeah,” he said quietly. “He always carried this letter. I thought he was bluffing when he said he’d write one before the campaign…”</p>
    <p>Aina studied him. “I assumed you’d want to deliver it on his behalf.”</p>
    <p>“…I would.” The boy hesitated, looking away. “Can I ask… how were his last moments?”</p>
    <p>Aina was silent for a moment. Then:</p>
    <p>“…He played a harmonica,” she said. “A tune from his village. He said it was made by your mother.”</p>
    <p>The boy let out a fragile laugh, breath catching.</p>
    <p>“Figures. He never shut up about that damn harmonica…”</p>
    <p>“…Can I ask where he is?” the boy said, trying to steady his voice.</p>
    <p>Aina nodded once. “South of the forest. You’ll see his body by the old campfire.”</p>
    <p>“…I want to bury him myself. But if I leave my post, they’ll dock my pay. Mother’s still sick, and I—”</p>
    <p>He stopped, flinching.</p>
    <p>“…Ah. Sorry. Not that you’d care.”</p>
    <p>The boy turned and walked off, letter clutched tightly to his chest, shoulders trembling beneath his armor.</p>
    <p>Aina stared after him.</p>
    <p>For the first time in her life, she chose not to walk away.</p>
    <p>But she didn’t have anything else to do.</p>
    <p>So she struck.</p>
    <p>Under cover of night, Aina moved like a shadow through the unfamiliar halls of Eleria’s castle.</p>
    <p>She didn’t crash through the gates. No blood. No fire. No declarations of war.</p>
    <p>Not this time.</p>
    <p>Instead, she walked quietly—softly—avoiding patrols, slipping past unaware guards who laughed and joked about festival wine and dancing lovers.</p>
    <p>Her eyes stayed cold. Focused.</p>
    <p>Room by room, hall by hall, she searched.</p>
    <p>And then—</p>
    <p>She found him.</p>
    <p>The King of Eleria. Alone in his quarters. No guards at his door. Not a soul in sight.</p>
    <p>He turned around from his desk, startled.</p>
    <p>“What the hell—!?”</p>
    <p>His words were cut short.</p>
    <p>Steel pierced flesh.</p>
    <p>Aina drove her blade through his chest, clean and fast.</p>
    <p>The king gasped, hands reaching for the weapon lodged in him. His crown clattered to the floor. Blood dripped onto parchment filled with diplomatic reports.</p>
    <p>His eyes locked with hers—wide, terrified, confused.</p>
    <p>But Aina said nothing.</p>
    <p>She only watched.</p>
    <p>Not out of anger.</p>
    <p>Not out of vengeance.</p>
    <p>But because it was what she was created to do.</p>
    <p>The king gurgled as he fell to his knees, mouth trembling, trying to speak—</p>
    <p>And then, finally, went still.</p>
    <p>Silence.</p>
    <p>Aina stood alone in the room.</p>
    <p>The same feeling again.</p>
    <p>Memories not her own flooding in—a childhood on horseback, a sister’s laughter, cold winters by the hearth, arguments in court, dreams of peace.</p>
    <p>He wasn’t a monster. He was a man.</p>
    <p>A man who made mistakes. Who ruled. Who loved.</p>
    <p>Aina’s sword slipped from her hand.</p>
    <p>And for a moment, she stared at the blood on her fingers.</p>
    <p>She wasn’t confused anymore.</p>
    <p>She just didn’t know who she was.<br>(...I just refuse to believe it)</p>
    <p>Aina completed her mission.</p>
    <p>The King of Eleria lay dead. The heart of the kingdom silenced.</p>
    <p>And yet…</p>
    <p>She found herself walking—not back to Celestara for praise or orders—but back to the campfire, now cold and smoldering, where the boy had played his final tune.</p>
    <p>He was still there.</p>
    <p>Still slumped where he'd fallen. Harmonicas don’t play themselves.</p>
    <p>She didn’t understand why she came back.</p>
    <p>She didn’t understand what moved her.</p>
    <p>But she picked up a shovel.</p>
    <p>It didn’t take long.</p>
    <p>The soil was loose, the grave shallow, and Aina—though tired—was strong.</p>
    <p>She placed him there gently, wrapping the letter in his hands, then covering him again under the cold earth of a forest that had seen too many dead.</p>
    <p>She stood in silence.</p>
    <p>Her face remained expressionless.</p>
    <p>But something inside itched. Something pulled.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t rage. Or grief. Or even regret.</p>
    <p>It was a crack in the glass.<br>(I told myself it was nothing)<br>(But I came back anyway)</p>
    <p>A fracture.<br>(I should’ve left. I didn’t.)</p>
    <p>A feeling.<br>(I Wished his soul Solace)</p>
    <p>Eleria crumbled.</p>
    <p>Without a king, without an heir, the kingdom spiraled into confusion. Nobles fought over scraps of control. The people panicked.</p>
    <p>But before anyone could establish a new order, Celestara swept in.</p>
    <p>Armies marched.</p>
    <p>Flags were replaced.</p>
    <p>No resistance could stand.</p>
    <p>And just like that, Eleria became another extension of Celestara’s growing empire—won not by politics.</p>
