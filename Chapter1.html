    <div class="chapter">
      <p>A girl walked along the moonlit path, her steps quiet but confident. The soft glow guided her to a small, worn-down bar tucked between stone buildings. She pushed the door open and stepped inside, the warm haze of liquor and dim lights greeting her like an old friend. Without hesitation, she made her way to the counter and slid onto a stool.</p>

  <p>“Hey boss. The usual, yeah?” she said.</p>

  <p>The bartender sighed. “...Alright. Coming right up.”</p>

  <p>As she waited, a voice perked up beside her.</p>

  <p>“Hey, Aina! Been a while since you came to this old, sunken place!”</p>

  <p>She turned to find Corvin, his grin nearly split his face.</p>

  <p>Aina’s lips curled into a genuine smile. She leaned back on her stool. “Oh hey! If it isn’t my old pal Corvin! Yeah, it has been a while.”</p>

  <p>They exchanged an easy, comfortable laugh.</p>

  <p>Corvin raised his glass mid-sip. “So... how’s your brother been doing?”</p>

  <p>Aina gave a soft chuckle. “Still going all out with his royal guard training. He’s completely obsessed now—won’t even take a day off.”</p>

  <p>Just then, the bartender returned and slid a glass of vivid red syrup towards Aina.</p>

  <p>Her eyes lit up instantly. “Heck yeah. It’s been way too long.” She snatched the glass and downed it in a single gulp, ignoring the sharp sweetness that made her eyes briefly twitch.</p>

  <p>The bartender raised an eyebrow. “So… when are you gonna pay your tab?”</p>

  <p>Aina froze mid-breath, a bead of sweat forming on her forehead. She forced a nervous laugh, looking anywhere but at him. “Ahem… what made you bring that up all of a sudden?”</p>

  <p>She was cut off as a sudden wave of darkness swept through the room, swallowing the light and silencing everything for a brief, suffocating moment.</p>

  <p>And then—it was gone.</p>

  <p>“The hell was that…?” Aina asked quickly. “You two alright?”</p>

  <p>Corvin and the bartender nodded, still stunned. Around them, the bar was unchanged—except for one thing. Aina noticed that some of the freshly served food now sat in a rotted heap, blackened and decayed.</p>

  <p>“Was that some kind of dark magic?” she asked sharply.</p>

  <p>“Maybe,” Corvin muttered, staring at his plate. “But why the hell are my fries just dust now?!”</p>

  <p>Aina's face tightened with concern. Her breath quickened. “I’m heading out. Need to check on someone.”</p>

  <p>She dashed out of the bar and sprinted home, unease crawling up her spine.</p>

  <p>At her house, she pushed the door open, tense—then sighed in relief.</p>

  <p>Her brother stood there, unharmed.</p>

  <p>“Rein,” she said, smiling weakly. “Thank goodness. Are you alright?”</p>

  <p>Rein looked confused and worried. “Yeah, but… what was that? Right after that darkness hit, our food supplies just vanished.”</p>

  <p>Before Aina could reply, the sound of panic erupted outside their home.</p>

  <p>It didn’t take long for humanity to understand the gods’ judgment.</p>

  <p>Not only had all food supplies vanished overnight—but now, they couldn’t even obtain new ones. Animals they hunted withered into dust the moment they died. Crops, once healthy and green, crumbled into powder at a single touch.</p>

  <p>Aina stepped outside into the tense morning haze, the air heavy with fear and fatigue. The ground cracked beneath her boots—dry, lifeless soil that once held green life.</p>

  <p>She made her way toward the center of BrightVale, where a small crowd had gathered.</p>

  <p>At the front stood Jorim, the village chief. His gray hair was matted with sweat, and his voice cracked as he tried—and failed—to bring order to the chaos around him.</p>

  <p>“Everyone, please! Panicking won’t help! We need to stay—stay calm and think this through!”</p>

  <p>But his words fell on deaf ears. Villagers shouted over each other, some clutching empty baskets, others holding rotten vegetables in trembling hands.</p>

  <p>Aina pushed through the crowd. “Hey, Jor! It’s happening to everyone too?!”</p>

  <p>Jorim spun around, eyes wide. “Oh, bloody hell, Aina! I thought you were a goner!”</p>

  <p>She gave a half-smile. “Not yet.”</p>

  <p>He sighed, rubbing his forehead. “Yeah, it’s happening everywhere. Everyone’s losing their minds now that the supplies are vanishing into thin air!”</p>

  <p>Aina looked around at the desperate faces. The reality was setting in—there was no outside help coming.</p>

  <p><strong>An hour passed.</strong></p>
       <p>The panic didn’t vanish—but it dulled. The shouting faded into murmurs. Villagers, drained from fear and hunger, had finally calmed enough to gather in a loose circle around the village center.</p>

  <p>A young man stepped forward, voice cracking with desperation. “Chief... how—why did this happen? How are we supposed to survive the month?!”</p>

  <p>Others echoed the question with weary eyes. Some clutched crying children. Some just stared at the dry earth, as if hoping for answers to bloom from it.</p>

  <p>Jorim stood at the center, shoulders squared—but his hands were trembling.</p>

  <p>“I’m… I’m sure we’ll find a way,” he said, forcing strength into his voice. “We always do.”</p>

  <p>He looked at them—his people. Looking to him for answers. And for the first time, he didn’t have any.</p>

  <p>Weeks passed.</p>

  <p>Word spread that King Eldrich Storm had vanished without a trace after the wave of darkness. Some whispered that he was taken by the gods themselves. Others believed he had fled in shame.</p>

  <p>People were starving. Villages teetered on the edge of madness. Sanity had been diminished. Desperation settled in.</p>

  <p>Aina stepped quietly through the rusted metal doors of a hidden building, long forgotten by most villagers. Inside, the air buzzed faintly with static. Strange machines lined the walls—old-world technology, all feeding into a single dead computer at the center of the room.</p>

  <p>Standing in front of it, a woman in a wrinkled lab coat stared into nothing.</p>

  <p>“Hey, Amelia,” Aina called out softly. “How’ve you been?”</p>

  <p>Amelia flinched and spun around. “O-Oh! Gosh, Aina! Y-you scared me there! …Ahem… I-I guess we’ve all had it rough lately…”</p>

  <p>“Yeah,” Aina replied, leaning against a desk. “Tell me about it.”</p>

  <p>Silence followed. Both women stared at the lifeless computer screen, its surface cold and gray.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Amelia burst into tears. “—Why is this happening to us? W-We didn’t even get answers! The Champion just vanished... a-and now this?!”</p>

  <p>Aina’s expression softened. She moved closer, wrapping Amelia in a quiet hug.</p>

  <p><em>("The civilians must be pressuring her to fix this mess... poor thing. Honestly, I pity her. I guess quitting was the right call heh" Aina cut the thought short with a deadpan blink. "Nevermind.")</em></p>

  <p>“Hey. Come on,” she said aloud. “If Lydia sees you like this, she’ll flip.”</p>

  <p>Amelia hesitated, then wiped her face. “Y-You’re right. W-we… we don’t need more problems right now.”</p>

  <p>“There, there,” Aina murmured, gently patting her back. Then her expression changed. “Oh yeah—Queen’s summoned you.”</p>

  <p>Amelia jolted. “A-Ah! I-I’m not ready!”</p>

  <p>“It’s by the Queen,” Aina corrected, tilting her head, “Not Lydia.”</p>

  <p>Amelia blinked, then nodded shakily. “R-right… I-I’ll just wash my face first…”</p>

  <p>She stepped out quickly, leaving Aina alone with the machine.</p>

  <p>Aina stood in silence for a moment, staring at the console. Then she moved—quietly opening drawers, searching with practiced familiarity.</p>

  <p>Her hand paused as she found what she was looking for: A syringe, unusually shaped, with a wide port for inserting a tube.</p>

  <p>She attached the tubing, rolled up her sleeve, and without flinching, extracted a small vial of her own blood—or what should’ve been blood. The liquid was... unnaturally red. Almost glowing.</p>

  <p>She stared at it for a moment.</p>

  <p>Then she inserted the tube into a narrow port on the computer.</p>

  <p>The machine flickered.</p>

  <p>A hum.</p>

  <p>Then, life.</p>

  <p>Lights blinked across the panel. A low drone filled the room. The screen glowed to life for the first time in years.</p>

  <p>Aina narrowed her eyes.</p>

  <p>“Alright… Let’s see what we’re working with.”</p>
