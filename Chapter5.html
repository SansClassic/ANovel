    <h1>Chapter 5 — Morality: Nothing More Than Words</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Aina stepped out of the bar and into BrightVale.</p>
    <p>She needed to grab something from her personal lab before heading to the meeting.</p>
    <p>Once, this village had been bright. Warm. Alive.</p>
    <p>Now it was a graveyard with roofs.</p>
    <p>People were buried beside their own homes—makeshift graves marked by broken tools or worn shoes. Grief didn’t even sting anymore. What’s the point of mourning when death is just a few minutes away?</p>
    <p>The town was quiet. Suffocatingly so.</p>
    <p>Some villagers were lying down, trying to sleep off the hunger. Children—barely able to walk—still tried to play with rocks and sticks, smiling as though pretending could fill their bellies.</p>
    <p>Then the village chief spotted her.</p>
    <p>“Hey, Aina. Going out again?” He coughed. “Welp... I do hope you’re doing better than the rest of us.”</p>
    <p>He tried to flash a smile, but it faltered halfway. “You’ve done everything you could. I know that. You didn’t sleep again last night, did you?”</p>
    <p>Aina gave a tired shrug. “Yeah… not like I could sleep. I kept thinking, kept... trying to find something to fix this mess.”</p>
    <p>The chief’s brows knit. “How long’s it been now?”</p>
    <p>Aina rubbed her eyes. “Eh… a week maybe? Heh.”</p>
    <p>“…A week of no sleep? Aina…”</p>
    <p>“Can’t sleep, Chief. You know how it is…”</p>
    <p>She kept walking.</p>
    <p>Aina arrived at her home.</p>
    <p>The door creaked softly open—and inside, warmth greeted her.</p>
    <p>“Aina! You’re back!” Rein’s voice was bright as ever. “So how’d the village look? Is everyone okay?”</p>
    <p>“Well... today’s checkup is still terrible,” she muttered. “But hey—could be worse.”</p>
    <p>Rein gave a hopeful nod. “Yeah, I get that. Oh! Lydia said I could stay home today! Weird, right?”</p>
    <p>Aina’s brow furrowed. “She did…? Did she say why?”</p>
    <p>“Said I probably needed rest after working a whole month straight.”</p>
    <p>Aina forced a chuckle. “That would be awesome... but maybe she’s right. You should rest. Just for today.”</p>
    <p>“Okay! Thanks, Sis!”</p>
    <p>Rein vanished into his room. Aina stood still, alone with her thoughts.</p>
    <p>("...Something’s off.")</p>
    <p>She stared at the closed door.</p>
    <p>("Rein would never choose rest... Lydia did something.")</p>
    <p>She shook it off. ("Whatever. What’s the worst that could happen…?")</p>
    <p>Aina entered her lab. Dust, metal, broken dreams—three months of failed ideas.</p>
    <p>She grabbed her schematics. Still incomplete.</p>
    <p>Even now… nothing clicked. Nothing fit.</p>
    <p>She sighed, rolled them up, and headed for the door—</p>
    <p>“Wait!” Rein stepped into view. “You’re going out again? To where?”</p>
    <p>“Ah, Lydia called me in for a meeting. Should be quick.”</p>
    <p>“Alright. If anything happens, call me, okay?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah, of course, Rein.”</p>
    <p>“See you tonight, then!”</p>
    <p>“Yeah… see you tonight.”</p>
    <p>She stepped into the cold wind of BrightVale.</p>
    <p>The skies were dark.</p>
    <p>She entered the meeting chamber.</p>
    <p>“Hey, Lydia,” she called, holding documents. “Got the reports—”</p>
    <p>Silence.</p>
    <p>“Uh… Lydia?”</p>
    <p>“...Sorry, Aina.”</p>
    <p>“Maybe… morality is no longer a choice.”</p>
    <p>“Guards. Pin her.”</p>
    <p>Rough hands slammed her to the floor.</p>
    <p>“W-What’s going on?”</p>
    <p>“Please… know this was never supposed to happen.”</p>
    <p>“Your sacrifice… I’ll make sure it won’t be in vain.”</p>
    <p>“No—wait!” Aina cried. “Just one more week! I swear!”</p>
    <p>“What about my brother…?”</p>
    <p>Footsteps. Amelia entered with the device.</p>
    <p>“I made it… as fast as I could.”</p>
    <p>Lydia took it. “Pick her up. Don’t let her move.”</p>
    <p>The guards obeyed. Aina gasped.</p>
    <p>The device neared—</p>
    <p>Aina exploded with magic.</p>
    <p>Guards flung back. Lydia staggered. The device clattered.</p>
    <p>Aina stood—but legs failed. Still, she refused to fall.</p>
    <p>“I see...” Lydia’s sword formed from light. “You had a bit of fight left.”</p>
    <p>She struck. Aina dodged, barely.</p>
    <p>“You’re not getting out of here.”</p>
    <p>Another strike. Aina staggered. Cornered.</p>
    <p>Her eyes met Lydia’s. She saw hesitation—maybe.</p>
    <p>Crack.</p>
    <p>Blade met temple.</p>
    <p>Aina fell.</p>
    <p>Blood pooled.</p>
    <p>Lydia froze. (“Oh... what have I...”)</p>
    <p>But her expression hardened. She stepped forward—</p>
    <p>And lowered the device.</p>
