    <h1>Chapter 5 — Morality: Nothing More Than Words</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Aina stepped out of the bar and into BrightVale.</p>
    <p>She needed to grab something from her personal lab before heading to the meeting.</p>
    <p>Once, this village had been bright. Warm. Alive.</p>
    <p>Now it was a graveyard with roofs.</p>
    <p>People were buried beside their own homes—makeshift graves marked by broken tools or worn shoes. Grief didn’t even sting anymore. What’s the point of mourning when death is just a few minutes away?</p>
    <p>The town was quiet. Suffocatingly so.</p>
    <p>Some villagers were lying down, trying to sleep off the hunger. Children—barely able to walk—still tried to play with rocks and sticks, smiling as though pretending could fill their bellies.</p>
    <p>Then the village chief spotted her.</p>
    <p>“Hey, Aina. Going out again?” He coughed. “Welp... I do hope you’re doing better than the rest of us.”</p>
    <p>He tried to flash a smile, but it faltered halfway. “You’ve done everything you could. I know that. You didn’t sleep again last night, did you?”</p>
    <p>Aina gave a tired shrug. “Yeah… not like I could sleep. I kept thinking, kept... trying to find something to fix this mess.”</p>
    <p>The chief’s brows knit. “How long’s it been now?”</p>
    <p>Aina rubbed her eyes. “Eh… a week maybe? Heh.”</p>
    <p>She forced a small smile. It looked more like a wince.</p>
    <p>The chief’s smile vanished.</p>
    <p>“…A week of no sleep? Aina…”</p>
    <p>His voice softened—genuine, heavy with concern.</p>
    <p>“Can’t sleep, Chief. You know how it is…”</p>
    <p>She kept walking.</p>
    <p>Aina arrived at her home.</p>
    <p>The door creaked softly open—and inside, warmth greeted her.</p>
    <p>“Aina! You’re back!” Rein’s voice was bright as ever. “So how’d the village look? Is everyone okay?”</p>
    <p>Aina, still on edge from the walk through BrightVale, felt her guard ease just a little.</p>
    <p>“Well... today’s checkup is still terrible,” she muttered. “But hey—could be worse.”</p>
    <p>Rein gave a hopeful nod. “Yeah, I get that. Oh! Lydia said I could stay home today! Weird, right? Considering the situation out there…”</p>
    <p>“I mean, the royal guard’s gotta be needed more than ever!”</p>
    <p>Aina’s brow furrowed. “She did…? Did she say why?”</p>
    <p>Rein shrugged, still cheerful.</p>
    <p>“Said I probably needed rest after working a whole month straight. Which—okay, fair. I’m exhausted. But still! I can’t sit still knowing people out there need help.”</p>
    <p>He smiled wide, almost proud of his guilt.</p>
    <p>Aina forced a chuckle. “That would be awesome... but maybe she’s right. You should rest. Just for today.”</p>
    <p>She moved toward the kitchen. “Your ration’s in the fridge, by the way.”</p>
    <p>“Okay! Thanks, Sis!”</p>
    <p>Rein vanished into his room. Aina stood still, alone with her thoughts.</p>
    <p>("...Something’s off.")</p>
    <p>She stared at the closed door.</p>
    <p>(""Rein would never choose rest. Not even if he collapsed. He’d jump into fire if it meant saving a soul...")</p>
    <p>Her thoughts narrowed like a blade. ("Lydia did something.")</p>
    <p>The weight of that idea settled over her shoulders—but she shook it off, exhaling through her nose.</p>
    <p>("Whatever. What’s the worst that could happen…?")</p>
    <p>Aina turned away and made her way to the back room—her lab.</p>
    <p>She opened the heavy door with a gentle push. The scent of dust and scorched metal greeted her like an old memory.</p>
    <p>Inside, the space was chaos.</p>
    <p>Three months of nonstop experimentation had turned the lab into a graveyard of ideas—scattered metal fragments, cracked magic crystals, wiring twisted around rusted pipes, even a few charred demon bones lined the workbench like trophies of failure.</p>
    <p>Amidst the mess, she grabbed a roll of schematics—blueprints of the Foundation’s internal structure. Annotated, creased, stained with ink and ash. It was her lifeline, the one map she trusted to guide her toward a replacement for the lost core.</p>
    <p>But even now... it was still incomplete.</p>
    <p>No matter what she tried, nothing had clicked. Nothing fit the way it needed to.</p>
    <p>With a tired sigh, she rolled up the schematics, tucking them beneath her arm, and headed toward the front door.</p>
    <p>But before she could reach for the handle—</p>
    <p>“Wait!” Rein stepped into view.</p>
    <p>“You’re going out again? To where?” His tone was curious, but concern lingered beneath it.</p>
    <p>Aina glanced back at him and offered a casual smile.</p>
    <p>“Ah, Lydia called me in for a meeting. Should be quick.”</p>
    <p>Rein gave a small nod, but the unease didn’t leave his face. He fished something from his pocket—a worn phone—and dangled it toward her.</p>
    <p>“Alright. If anything happens, call me, okay?”</p>
    <p>Aina gave him a soft chuckle. “Yeah, of course, Rein.”</p>
    <p>He waved. “See you tonight, then!”</p>
    <p>“Yeah… see you tonight.”  Aina replied, voice just a little quieter than before.</p>
    <p>She stepped out the door, the familiar chill of BrightVale air brushing her cheeks as she descended the worn path.</p>
    <p>The wind had picked up.</p>
    <p>The skies were dark.</p>
    <p>But her footsteps carried her forward—toward the meeting, and whatever truth waited on the other side.</p>
    <h3>Aina stepped into the meeting chamber.</h3>
    <p>Lydia stood at the far end, facing the wall. Her cloak hung heavy, her posture distant—like she was trying to disappear into the stone itself.</p>
    <p>“Hey, Lydia,” she called, holding documents. “Got the reports ready for the week…”</p>
    <p>Silence.</p>
    <p>“Uh… Lydia?”</p>
    <p>Still no answer.</p>
    <p>Aina was just about to crack a joke—something dumb to break the tension—when Lydia finally spoke.</p>
    <p>Her voice was low. Strained.</p>
    <p>“...Sorry, Aina.”</p>
    <p>She didn’t turn.</p>
    <p>“Maybe… morality is no longer a choice.”</p>
    <p>And then—</p>
    <p>“Guards. Pin her.”</p>
    <p>Before Aina could react, two armored guards burst from the shadows behind her. Rough hands grabbed her arms and shoulders, slamming her to the cold stone floor.</p>
    <p>The impact knocked the breath from her chest.</p>
    <p>Her mind went blank.</p>
    <p>(This… is really happening? No...)</p>
    <p>“H-Hey… Lydia?” she wheezed, struggling against the weight pinning her down. “W-What’s going on? D-Did I do something wrong? Haha… y-you know I’d never do anything bad, r-right?”</p>
    <p>Her voice cracked.</p>
    <p>Lydia still hadn’t turned. But now, slowly, she did.</p>
    <p>Her face was haggard. Pale. Eyes rimmed with dark circles—eyes that had seen too much, lost too much, and carried too much.</p>
    <p>She looked… broken.</p>
    <p>“Aina,” Lydia said quietly, “Please… know this was never supposed to happen.”</p>
    <p>She stepped forward, slowly. Every step felt like a weight dragging her down.</p>
    <p>“Your sacrifice… I’ll make sure it won’t be in vain.”</p>
    <p>“No—wait!” Aina cried out, her voice rising with panic. “Lydia, please! Give me another week—just a week! I swear I’ll find something! I’m close, I can feel it, just—just don’t do this!”</p>
    <p>Lydia didn’t reply.</p>
    <p>Her gaze was blank. Hollow. Distant.</p>
    <p>“What about my brother…?”</p>
    <p>Lydia flinched.</p>
    <p>Her eyes wavered. For just a moment, guilt flooded her face—raw, unguarded. Her lips parted as if to say something, as if a part of her wanted to stop.</p>
    <p>But then—</p>
    <p>A breath. A blink. Her expression hardened again.</p>
    <p>The mask returned.</p>
    <p>in that split moment, Aina saw the hesitation.</p>
    <p>“Who’s gonna take care of him? He still thinks this world has hope. Lydia—please! You can’t—”</p>
    <p>The chamber door creaked. Footsteps. A figure entered, lab coat flaring slightly at the edges. Amelia’s face was unreadable.</p>
    <p>She carried the device in her hands—cold, sleek, and unmistakably cruel in its design. Sharp, jagged clamps curved forward like the talons of a steel predator.</p>
    <p>It was built for one thing only: To extract the heart.</p>
    <p>“Here,” Amelia said softly, her voice barely above a whisper. She didn’t look at Aina. “I made it… as fast as I could.”</p>
    <p>She held it out.</p>
    <p>Lydia hesitated—just for a moment—then took the device with steady hands.</p>
    <p>Aina’s breath hitched, her chest tightening like it was already being crushed.</p>
    <p>“Wait…” she choked out, voice trembling. “No. No—please.”</p>
    <p>Lydia’s eyes hardened.</p>
    <p>“Pick her up,” she commanded. “H-Hold her. Don’t let her move.”</p>
    <p>The guards obeyed.</p>
    <p>Aina was forced down to her knees, her arms locked behind her, head yanked upright.</p>
    <p>The cold floor bit into her legs.</p>
    <p>Her heart pounded.</p>
    <p>Her breath came sharp—suffocating.</p>
    <p>Lydia stepped forward And Raised The Device</p>
    <p>Her hand twitched. She hesitated But still, it moved toward Aina’s chest.</p>
    <p>And then—</p>
    <p>Aina gathered what little magic she had left—</p>
    <p>And unleashed it A shockwave from her body—wild, uncontrolled, desperate.</p>
    <p>The guards were flung back in a crash of metal. Lydia staggered. The device slipped from her grasp and clattered across the floor.</p>
    <p>Aina gasped stood—but legs failed. The magic had drained her dry. Her vision swam. Still—</p>
    <p>She refused to fall.</p>
    <p>Aina stood, panting, as Lydia straightened across the room.</p>
    <p>“I see...” Lydia muttered. “So you had a bit of fight left in you after all.”</p>
    <p>A golden light pulsed in her palm.</p>
    <p>A sword began to form—radiant and sharp, shaped from the golden light.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t want this, Aina,” Lydia said quietly. “But I guess you’ve decided to make it harder than it needed to be.”</p>
    <p>She struck. Aina dodged by instinct. Her body moved on memory, not strength. She slipped beneath the first swing..</p>
    <p>The blade whistled past her cheek.</p>
    <p>Another strike came. Aina staggered back, her feet scraping against the floor. She was cornered.</p>
    <p>“You’re quick,” Lydia said, frustrated. “But what’s the point, Aina? You’re not getting out of here.”</p>
    <p>Another strike. Aina staggered. Cornered.</p>
    <p>Aina felt lightheaded. Her legs dragged. Her vision swam.</p>
    <p>Aina’s eyes met Lydia’s one last time. She saw hesitation there—</p>
    <p>she thought.For a moment, she believed it might stop.</p>
    <h4>Crack.</h4>
    <p>The blade caught the edge of her temple.</p>
    <p>A sickening sound echoed through the chamber.</p>
    <p>Aina collapsed.</p>
    <p>Blood pooled where she fell, silver strands soaked with red.</p>
    <p>Lydia froze.</p>
    <p>She stared at what she had done—</p>
    <p>Face pale. Hands trembling.</p>
    <p>(" Oh... what have I... ")</p>
    <p>But the shock didn’t last.</p>
    <p>Her expression hardened. Cold. Detached.</p>
    <p>As if she had already buried the pain.</p>
    <p>She stepped forward grabbing the device. The device still hummed softly.</p>
    <p>And lowered the device Into Aina's Chest.</p>
